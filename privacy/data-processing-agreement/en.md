In carrying out their work, the Processor shall exclusively use employees who are bound to maintain confidentiality and who have previously been familiarized with the relevant data protection provisions. The Processor and any person under their authority who has access to personal data of the Controller may only process such data exclusively in accordance with instructions from the Controller, including the authority granted in this agreement, unless they are legally obliged to process such data.

## § 8 Sub-processors

1. Subcontracting relationships within the meaning of this provision shall be understood to mean those services which relate directly to the provision of the principal service. This does not include ancillary services used by the Processor, e.g. telecommunications or postal/transport services. However, the Processor shall be obliged to undertake appropriate and legally binding contractual agreements and control measures to ensure the data protection and the data security of the Controller's data, including in relation to outsourced ancillary services.
2. The Controller agrees to the [sub-processors](https://www.openproject.org/legal/data-processing-agreement/sub-processors/) named at the time of the conclusion of this contract. The Processor warrants that an data processing agreement has been concluded with all named sub-processors in accordance with Article 28 (2-4) of the GDPR.
3. Customer shall permit Processor to engage additional sub-processors or to replace existing sub-processors provided that:
   - the Processor notifies the Controller of such new subcontracting in text form, e.g. by e-mail, before the start of processing by the sub-processor and the Controller does not object to the subcontracting in text form within two weeks. After expiry of the objection period, the modification shall be deemed approved within the meaning of Article 28 (2) of the GDPR.
   - The Processor concludes an agreement with the sub-processor in accordance with Art. 28 (2-4) of the GDPR.
4. If a sub-processor is to be used who processes personal data of the Controller outside the European Economic Area, this is only permitted if the requirements for international data transfer pursuant to Art. 44 et seq. GDPR are complied with. This is particularly the case if the processing takes place in a country whose level of data protection has been recognized as adequate by the EU Commission pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR. In addition, a data transfer is lawful if EU standard data protection clauses have been concluded with the sub-processor.
5. The Processor shall regularly check the sub-processor's compliance with the GDPR. It shall be contractually stipulated that the sub-processor shall tolerate these control measures and any on-site inspections. The Controller shall be entitled to receive information on request about the essential content of the contract and the implementation of the Sub-processor's obligations relevant to data protection, if necessary also by inspecting the relevant contractual documents.
6. The transfer of personal data of the Controller to the sub-processor and the subcontractor's initial activity shall only be permitted once all legal requirements for subcontracting have been met.

## § 9 Control rights of the Controller

1. Upon appropriate advance notice, the Controller is entitled to have inspections performed by auditors to be appointed on a case-by-case basis. The Processor shall ensure that the Controller can satisfy themselves of the Processor's compliance with the obligations in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. The Processor shall grant the Controller access to the Processor's property and business premises upon prior arrangement of an appointment during normal local operating and business hours. The Processor is required to furnish the necessary information to the Controller on request and to demonstrate, in particular, the implementation of the technical and organizational measures.
2. Proof of such measures, which do not only relate to a specific engagement, may be provided in the form of compliance with approved rules of conduct in accordance with Art. 40 GDPR; certification according to an approved certification procedure pursuant to Art. 42 GDPR; current certificates, reports or report extracts from independent bodies (e.g. auditor, internal audit department, data protection officer); suitable certification by IT security or data protection audit (e.g. according to BSI Basic Protection).

## § 10 Notification of breaches by the Processor

2. To the extent possible, the Processor shall assist the Controller in complying with the obligations set out in Articles 30 to 36 GDPR concerning the security of personal data, notification obligations in the event of personal data breaches, data protection impact assessments and prior consultations.
